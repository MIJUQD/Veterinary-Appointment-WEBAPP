# Veterinary-Appointment-WEBAPP
This beginner-level capstone project was part of our Third-year, First-semester coursework for Systems Integration and Architecture coursework, Although we did not develop the WebApp itself, the project required us to approach it conceptually, which we simulated the process using system modeling and model-driven architecture techniques.
